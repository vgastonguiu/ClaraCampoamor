    <h2>Timeline of Clara´s life</h2>   
    
    <h3>Roots<h/3>
    <p>A native of Madrid, Clara Campoamor was born in 1888 to working-class parents. Her father, Manuel, died during her childhood, leaving her mother, Pilar, to raise the family under difficult economic circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Working to Study</h3>  
    <p>Clara Campoamor started working when she was 13, first as a seamstress,later at the postal service, before obtaining a position as teacher of typewriting. She also worked as a secretary for the newspaper La Tribuna and translated French for a publishing house.</p> 
    <p>In 1923, she finished a university diploma by taking evening classes and the following year earned a law degree. These are significant accomplishments, given the few women who even gained admission to Spanish universities.<p>

    <h3>From Activist to PM</h3> 
    <p>Increasingly drawn to politics, Campoamor championed women's rights. Affiliating with the Spanish Social Party, she worked to improve conditions for women.</p> 
    <p>When Manuel Primo de Rivera, dictator from 1923–1930, nominated her to join the Junta of the Ateneo, she refused and also turned down the Great Cross of Alphonso XII, another attempt by the regime to win her support.</p>
  
    <p>After Primo de Rivera fell and Alphonso XIII abdicated in 1931, Spaniards declared the Second Republic, and Campoamor won election to the Constituent Cortes (Assembly).</p> 
      
    <p>While another prominent female deputy, Victoria Kent, urged the Cortes to postpone dealing with the issue of female suffrage, Campoamor refused to wait. She founded the Feminine Republican Union. Her insistence that the Republic grant suffrage alienated many male deputies and left Campoamor isolated, even within her own party.</p>

    <p>She failed to win reelection in 1933, but the Lerroux government made her director of social services. Campoamor served, however, under a rightist minister and soon resigned. In 1934, she was part of the investigating commission sent to Oviedo following the brutal suppression of the miners' strike.</p>

    <h3>Civil War</h3>
    <p>When the Civil War began in July 1936, Campoamor immediately went into exile. Along with many other Spanish exiles, Campoamor made her way to Argentina. She attempted to return to her country, but the Franco government refused to grant her residence.</p> 
    <p>Despondent over the failure of the Second Republic and what had happened to Spain, Campoamor abandoned politics. Instead, she translated French novels into Spanish and wrote several biographies, including one of Juana Ines de la Cruz, the 17th-century Mexican poet and intellectual.</p> 

    <h3>Rest in Power</h3>
    <p>Campoamor moved to Switzerland in 1955, where she worked in the law office of Antoinette Quinche, a marital lawyer and longtime friend. Campoamor was discouraged and yearned to return to her homeland.</p> 
    <p> In 1972, nearly blind, she died from cancer in Lausanneand and her cremated remains were buried in San Sebastian.</p>
